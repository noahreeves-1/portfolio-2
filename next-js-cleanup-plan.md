# Next.js Portfolio Optimization & Cleanup Plan

## 📋 Overview
This document tracks the optimization and reorganization of the portfolio website to leverage Next.js 15 best practices and improve performance.

## 🎯 Goals
- Reduce bundle size by 50% (800KB → 400KB)
- Improve Time to Interactive (3-4s → 1-2s)
- Better folder organization and maintainability
- Proper Server/Client component separation

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Performance Issues
- ❌ All components marked as "use client" unnecessarily
- ❌ Over-use of dynamic imports causing slower initial render  
- ❌ Heavy libraries (Three.js, Leaflet) loading inefficiently
- ❌ No Server Components despite using Next.js 15
- ❌ Data embedded within components instead of separate files

### Organization Issues
- ❌ 19 components in one flat `/app/components/` folder
- ❌ 116+ unorganized images in `/public/`
- ❌ No TypeScript type definitions structure
- ❌ No separation between UI, layout, and feature components

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Performance Optimizations (High Priority)

#### Task 1: Convert Static Components to Server Components
- [x] **WhoMe.tsx** - Remove "use client", extract animation to wrapper
- [x] **SocialProof.tsx** - Convert to Server Component  
- [x] **Skills.tsx** - Server Component with client animation wrapper
- [x] **Footer.tsx** - Pure Server Component (already was)
- [x] **DiagonalDivider.tsx** - Pure Server Component (already was)

**Expected Impact:** 30-40% bundle size reduction

#### Task 2: Extract Data to Separate Files
- [x] Create `/app/lib/data/` directory
- [ ] Extract projects data to `projects.ts`
- [x] Extract skills data to `skills.ts`
- [x] Extract company logos to `companies.ts`
- [x] Update components to import from data files

**Expected Impact:** Better caching, reduced client bundle

#### Task 3: Optimize Heavy Library Loading
- [ ] **Three.js** - Implement selective imports
- [ ] **Three.js** - Add intersection observer preloading
- [ ] **Leaflet** - Lazy load only when visible
- [x] Remove unnecessary dynamic imports in `page.tsx`

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% faster initial load

### Phase 2: Folder Structure Reorganization

#### Task 4: Create New Component Structure
```
/app/components/
├── ui/          # Reusable UI components
├── layout/      # Layout components (Navbar, Footer)
├── sections/    # Page sections (Hero, Projects, etc)
└── features/    # Feature-specific (projects/, map/, email/)
```

- [x] Create folder structure
- [x] Move components to appropriate folders
- [x] Add barrel exports (index.ts files)
- [x] Update all import paths

#### Task 5: Create Library Structure
```
/app/lib/
├── data/        # Extracted data
├── types/       # TypeScript interfaces
├── constants/   # Configuration constants
└── utils/       # Helper functions
```

- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Extract projects data to `projects.ts`
- [ ] Extract animation variants
- [ ] Extract constants
- [ ] Create utility functions

### Phase 3: Three.js Optimization (Attempted)

#### What We Tried
- [x] Replaced wildcard import (`import * as THREE`) with selective imports
- [x] Attempted source-level imports from `three/src/`
- [x] Added intersection observer for lazy loading
- [x] Created HeroAnimationLazy wrapper component

#### Results
- Bundle size increased from 414 KB to 442 KB
- Three.js tree-shaking is complex with Next.js
- The animation component is now properly lazy-loaded with intersection observer

#### Lessons Learned
- Three.js optimization requires more advanced bundler configuration
- Consider alternatives: simpler animation libraries or CSS animations
- The intersection observer pattern works well for lazy loading

### Phase 4: Asset Organization

#### Task 6: Reorganize Public Assets
```
/public/assets/
├── images/
│   └── projects/    # Project screenshots
├── logos/
│   ├── tech/        # Technology logos
│   └── companies/   # Company logos
└── icons/           # General icons
```

- [ ] Create asset folder structure
- [ ] Move and categorize all images
- [ ] Update component imports
- [ ] Create asset constants file

### Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations

#### Task 7: Implement Server Actions
- [ ] Convert `/api/send` to Server Action
- [ ] Add progressive enhancement to contact form
- [ ] Improve error handling

#### Task 8: Image Optimization
- [ ] Add proper sizing to all images
- [ ] Implement blur placeholders
- [ ] Set priority loading for above-fold images
